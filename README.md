# Exercise Routine Creator

I'd always attended the gym and always ended up searching google for the appropriate exercies to do. I'd also watched YouTubers and followed their routines. This got me thinking. Why don't i compile all the best exercises for every body part into one simple application.

This is what i did.

## Process of creation

I don't have any experience making physical applications so i decided to simply use Python and create lists. I created arrays/lists for all different body parts and then compiled them into one big list. This worked fine and i then went on to sort the randomisation. I created the random generator and the loop and there the program was. It worked perfectly.

## Additions

I then realised that i would want to be able to only generate single body parts. The application could only do full body workouts. This was fine but i knew i needed to implement a way of only selecting a single muscle. That was when i added the next part of the menu. I fiddled around with the arrays, split them up and then set out an easy to use system to do this.

I'm very proud of the creation.
